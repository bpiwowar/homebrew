        This will be picked up by CMake's build system and likey cause the
        build to fail, trying to link to a 32-bit version of expat.
        You may need to move this file out of the way for this brew to work.

      puts <<-EOS.undent
        Having `GREP_OPTIONS` set this way causes CMake builds to fail.
        You will need to `unset GREP_OPTIONS` before brewing.
